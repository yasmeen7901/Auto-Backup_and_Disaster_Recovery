### ðŸŒ³ *Auto Backup and Disaster Recovery in AWS*  

*1. Amazon EC2 (Compute Layer)*  
â”œâ”€â”€ *1.1 Launch Primary EC2 Instance*  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Choose AMI, instance type, and configure networking  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Install and configure applications  
â”œâ”€â”€ *1.2 Launch Secondary EC2 Instance (Failover)*  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Choose same AMI and instance type for failover  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Deploy in a different availability zone for high availability  
â””â”€â”€ *1.3 Elastic IP (Optional)*  
    â””â”€â”€ Assign Elastic IP for both instances (if needed)

*2. AWS Backup Service*  
â”œâ”€â”€ *2.1 Automated Backup*  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Create a Backup Vault to store backups  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Define a Backup Plan (daily/weekly)  
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Select EC2 instances as backup resources  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Assign IAM Role with backup permissions  
â””â”€â”€ *2.2 Manual Backup (Optional)*  
    â””â”€â”€ Use AWS Backup console to create on-demand backups

*3. Route 53 (DNS and Failover Routing)*  
â”œâ”€â”€ *3.1 Configure DNS Record for Primary Server*  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Create A record with Elastic IP of Primary EC2  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Set routing policy as *Failover (Primary)*  
â”œâ”€â”€ *3.2 Configure DNS Record for Secondary Server*  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Create A record with Elastic IP of Secondary EC2  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Set routing policy as *Failover (Secondary)*  
â””â”€â”€ *3.3 Health Check Setup*  
    â”œâ”€â”€ Monitor HTTP/HTTPS endpoint of Primary EC2  
    â”œâ”€â”€ Define failure threshold and interval  
    â””â”€â”€ Associate health check with Primary DNS record  

---

*4. Disaster Recovery (Failover Process)*  
â”œâ”€â”€ *4.1 Primary Server Failure Detected* (Health check fails)  
â””â”€â”€ *4.2 Route 53 Automatically Switches to Secondary Server*  

---

*5. IAM Permissions (Security Layer)*  
â””â”€â”€ Grant necessary IAM permissions for EC2, Route 53, and AWS Backup services
